<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About The Hexagonal Game

Hexagonal is a journey into the world of automation, building, and the pursuit of civilization. Dive into a universe where your creativity knows no bounds, and every decision shapes the landscape around you. Hexagonal stands out with its innovative use of hexagonal tilemaps. This unique grid system not only challenges your strategic thinking but also enhances the visual appeal, offering a fresh and captivating gaming experience. 

<div align="center">In the words of CGP Grey, 'Hexagons, are the bestagons.'</div><br>

We've poured countless hours into learning, and improving different aspect of Hexagonal, ensuring it provides a seamless and rewarding experience for builders and automation enthusiasts alike. However, like any indie game, there is a lot of room for improvement. Now, we're excited to open source this project under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) License, inviting the community to learn from our work and contribute to its evolution.
